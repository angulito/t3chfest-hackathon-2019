# Hackathon T3chfest 2019 - **First prize**

**Hackathon theme**: IoT in the rural world.

## Grow and Harvest app

This application is a prototype created for the T3chfest Hackathon 2019. The main goal is that farmers can rent agricultural machinery so they can use the most recent and modern machinery without having to buy them, which usually is cheaper.

## Presentation slides

[Here](./doc/presentation_slides.pdf) you can see the presentation slides.

## Deploy

Deployed to IBM cloud using: **IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry**

*Note: As it is deployed using a free account, probably this app will disappear in the short future if it has not enough requests.*
