# Hackathon T3chfest 2019 - **First prize**

**Hackathon theme**: IoT in the rural world.

## Grow and Harvest app

This application is a prototype created for the T3chfest Hackathon 2019. 

Farmers often leave their fields uncultivated due to the excessive cost of machines such as tractors and harvesters. Our idea is to connect small farmers with machine owners in an effort to make renting easy, cheap and accessible. This way, they can use the most recent and modern machinery for their fields at a fraction of the purchase cost, increasing production and earnings.
